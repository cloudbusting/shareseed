	Short: "Securely share a BIP39 mnemonic seed in multiple parts, and recombine from a subset of parts.",
	Long: `
Use Shamir Secret Sharing to protect BIP39 mnemonic seeds by sharing in parts, and to recover from those parts.

Warnings
--------
Test this utility with an unimportant seed to share and recombine parts to understand its function. 
(Valid test mnemonic seeds can be created at https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

To reduce the possible risk of a malware infection capturing the inputs or outputs of this utility, it is strongly 
recommended that you run this tool from a secure OS, such as a live boot of tails.

Typing or storing your seed phrase in plain text on your normal desktop OS is extremely dangerous.
Additionally, storing the output parts of this utility together is no safer than simply storing your seed in plain text.
